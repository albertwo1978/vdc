=== Deployment assumptions

This archetype is based on common patterns identified while working with customers deploying AKS workloads in their production environments. It may need to be changed to reflect your organization's individual requirements. 

Please review these assumptions and determine the appropriate course of action while planning your production AKS implementation. 

1. *Container Registry* - An https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/container-registry/container-registry-intro[Azure Container Registry] (ACR) is created as part of this archetype and deployed to the `{org}-{deployment-name}-acr-rg` resource group. 
   - Image pull RBAC rights to the ACR instance have been granted to the cluster service principal. A reference to the AKS documentation can be found https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/container-registry/container-registry-auth-aks[here]. 
   - For Premium ACR deployments, service endpoints are also enabled. +

[ALBERTWO REVIEW - Formatting]
Organizations may have their own container registry for managing container images. If so, the ACR can be safely deleted. If deploying individual modules, link:overview.adoc#step-4-deploy-azure-container-registry[Step 4] can be skipped with no impact to the remaining deployment. 

1. *Audit Logging* - https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/insights/container-insights-overview[Azure Container Insights] and https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/aks/view-master-logs[Kubernetes master node logging] are enabled by default for this archetype. Collected logs are sent to three different resource types (Azure Log Analytics, Azure Storage, and Azure Event Hub), all created in the `{org}-{deployment-name}-diagnostics-rg` resource group. The other modules in this archetype expect Log Analytics to be deployed, however you may have different requirements for diagnostics. If so, you will need to make modifications to the archetype accordingly.

1. *AAD Roles* - The toolkit encourages the separation of responsibilities using Azure Active Directory role-based access control (RBAC) to determine which users and teams can create and manage specific resources. A full description of these roles and their permissions can be found link:../../understand/roles.md[here]. The link:overview.adoc#step-by-step-archetype-deployment[step-by-step archetype deployment] assumes that these user roles have been created and deployments are being performed by accounts using these permissions. [CB/ALBERTWO REVIEW - Need to identify additional permissions per role required for AKS workload and update documentation/scripts.]

1. *Kubernetes personas* - This deployment integrates Kubernetes RBAC with Azure Active Directory and creates a sample set of personas for managing AKS cluster resources. 
   - A description of Kubernetes RBAC authorization can be found https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/[here].
   - The scripts that implement the role bindings for the sample personas can be found link:../../../scripts/aks/create-cluster-rbac-role-bindings.sh[here]. +

[ALBERTWO REVIEW - Formatting]   
The table below provides a description of the sample personas and role bindings. You should evaluate your specific requirements and make appropriate changes:

[options="header",cols="a,,"]
|===
| Persona | Kubernetes RBAC | Azure Resource RBAC

| *Cluster Admin*
| cluster-admin built-in cluster role
| Reader access to AKS cluster resource groups

| *NOC*
| view built-in cluster role extended for resource listings
| Reader access to AKS cluster resource groups

| *Developer*
| edit built-in cluster role bound to namespace
| Reader access to AKS cluster resource groups
|===

== Create your archetype configuration file

The toolkit provides an example configuration file for the AKS environment. You will need to create a new version of this file before running your deployment.

1. Navigate to the toolkit's link:../../../archetypes/aks[archetypes/aks] folder.
1. Make a copy of the `archetypes.test.json` and name the copy `archetypes.json`.
1. Edit `archetypes.json` providing the subscription, organization, networking, and other configuration information that you want to use for your deployment. You will need to use some of the same values when creating the configuration for the shared services and on-premises environments.

If your copy of the toolkit is associated with the git repository, the link:../../../.gitignore[.gitignore] file is set to prevent your deployment `archetypes.json` file from being pushed to your code repository.

=== Setting archetype parameters

Modifications to these `archetypes.json` parameters are required in order to successfully deploy the archetype. The following table describes the minimum modifications required to deploy under default conditions. Additional modifications can be made, but are not covered in this document.

== Run the deployment

=== Single step archetype deployment - Required permissions: Subscription Owner

This section performs an end-to-end deployment of the AKS archetype. It assumes the account performing the deployment has Owner permissions to the Subscription where the archetype is being deployed. 

Start the workload deployment by running the following commands based on the platform you are deploying from:

.Docker
[source,bash]
python vdc.py create workload -path archetypes/aks/archetypes.json

.Linux/OSX
[source,bash]
python3 vdc.py create workload -path archetypes/aks/archetypes.json 

.Windows
[source,cmd]
py vdc.py create workload -path archetypes/aks/archetypes.json 

This deployment creates the following resource groups and AKS archetype resources.

[options="header",cols="a,"]
|===
| Resource Group | Description

| `{org}-{deployment-name}-diagnostics-rg` 
| Monitoring resources (Azure Log Analytics, Azure Event Hub, Azure Storage)

| `{org}-{deployment-name}-kv-rg` 
| Azure key vault for secret management.

| `{org}-{deployment-name}-net-rg` 
| Networking resource (Azure Virtual Network, Network Security Groups, Route Tables, DDOS policy)

| `{org}-{deployment-name}-arc-rg` 
| Azure container registry for image management. 

| `{org}-{deployment-name}-rg` 
| Azure AKS resource type for the managed kubernetes cluster.

| `MC_{org}-{deployment-name}-rg_{org}-{deployment-name}-k8s_{region}`
| Azure resources backing the AKS cluster (Virtual Machines, Managed Disks, Availability Set, etc).
|===

This completes the AKS archetype single step deployment.

Please proceed to the link:overview.adoc#aks-cluster-topology-view[AKS Cluster Topology Diagram] for an overview of the AKS resources deployed and login instructions. 

DO NOT proceed to the next deployment step if you have performed the Single Step Archetype Deployment. 

=== Step-by-step archetype deployment - Required permissions: Based on admin role

This section assumes the organization has separated administrative responsibilities into a core set of roles using role-based access control (RBAC). Please review the link:../../understand/roles.md[roles and permissions] section to understand those roles and their associated permissions. 

If your account has Subscription Owner permissions you can deploy all modules with your account. 

==== Step 1: Deploy operations and monitoring resources - Required role: SysOps

This step pre-provisions target resources that will be used for collection and analysis Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) logging data. 

Later in the workload deployment process, kubernetes master node logging is enabled in the Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) environment and logs are passed to these target resources for collection and analysis. More details on master node logging in AKS can be found https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/aks/view-master-logs[here]. 

Two modules are deployed in this step:

- The `la` module creates the log analytics workspace and Azure storage account used for collecting and analyzing Azure Monitor logs. 
- The `event-hub` module creates an Azure Event Hub namespace and default Event Hub, along with setting up the default authorization rules. 

Start the module deployments by running the following commands based on the platform you are deploying from:

.Docker
[source,bash]
python vdc.py create workload -path archetypes/aks/archetypes.json -m la
python vdc.py create workload -path archetypes/aks/archetypes.json -m event-hub

.Linux/OSX
[source,bash]
python3 vdc.py create workload -path archetypes/aks/archetypes.json -m la
python3 vdc.py create workload -path archetypes/aks/archetypes.json -m event-hub

.Windows
[source,cmd]
py vdc.py create workload -path archetypes/aks/archetypes.json -m la
py vdc.py create workload -path archetypes/aks/archetypes.json -m event-hub

These deployments creates the `{org}-{deployment-name}-diagnostics-rg` resource group that hosts the resources described in the following table.

[options="header",cols="a,,"]
|===
| Resource | Type | Description

| `{org}-{deployment-name}-la`
| Log Analytics
| Log Analytics instance for monitoring the AKS cluster workload.

| `{org}{deployment-name}diag{uniquestring}` (dashes removed)
| Storage Account
| Storage Account for collecting AKS workload logs.

| `{org}-{deployment-name}-la`
| Event Hub Namespace
| Event Hub Namespace with `{org}-diagnostics-eventhub` Event Hub for collecting AKS workload logs. 
|===

==== Step 2: Deploy Key Vault - Required role: SecOps

The next step is deploying the kv module, which creates a Key Vault resource.
   - The key vault resource is added as a service endpoint to the AKS virtual network.
   - A demo CA cert is created by OpenSSL and stored in the key vault. [ALBERTWO REVIEW - Sync with Kirk about Digicert to replace OpenSSL cert.]

Secrets defined in the `archetype.json` as well as creating encryption keys (used in Azure Disk Encryption extension) are stored in the Key Vault and are used by other resources will use in subsequent deployment steps.

Secrets used for the AKS deployment (ssh, secure tiller, etc) - 
   - CA cert for scoped keys

These values are stored as secrets in the vault. To modify the default values for these passwords edit the link:../../../modules/kv/1.0/azureDeploy.parameters.json[Key Vault (kv) module parameters file] and update the secrets-object parameter.

Start the module deployment by running the following command based on the platform you are deploying from:

.Docker
[source,bash]
python vdc.py create workload -path archetypes/aks/archetypes.json -m kv

.Linux/OSX
[source,bash]
python3 vdc.py create workload -path archetypes/aks/archetypes.json -m kv

.Windows
[source,cmd]
py vdc.py create workload -path archetypes/aks/archetypes.json -m kv

This deployment creates the `{org}-{deployment-name}-kv-rg` resource group that hosts the resources described in the following table.

[options="header",cols="a,,"]
|===
| Resource | Type | Description

| `{org}-{deployment-name}-kv` 
| Key Vault
| Key Vault instance for the workload. One certificate deployed by default.

| `{org}{deployment-name}kvdiag{uniquestring}` (dashes removed)
| Storage account
| Location of Key Vault audit logs.
|===

==== Step 3: Deploy the virtual network - Required role: NetOps 

This step involves two resource deployments in the following order:

- The `nsg` module creates the network security groups (NSGs) and Application security groups (ASGs) that secure the workload's virtual network. By default, the example workload net deployment creates a set of NSGs and ASGs compatible with an n-tier application, consisting of web, business, and data tiers. 
- The `workload-net` module creates the workload's virtual network, along with setting up the default subnet and User Defined Routes (UDRs) used to route traffic to the shared services network. This deployment also creates the VNet peering that connects the shared services and workload networks.

Start the module deployments by running the following commands based on the platform you are deploying from:

.Docker
[source,bash]
python vdc.py create workload -path archetypes/aks/archetypes.json -m nsg
python vdc.py create workload -path archetypes/aks/archetypes.json -m workload-net

.Linux/OSX
[source,bash]
python3 vdc.py create workload -path archetypes/aks/archetypes.json -m nsg
python3 vdc.py create workload -path archetypes/aks/archetypes.json -m workload-net

.Windows
[source,cmd]
py vdc.py create workload -path archetypes/aks/archetypes.json -m nsg
py vdc.py create workload -path archetypes/aks/archetypes.json -m workload-net

These deployments creates the `{org}-{deployment-name}-net-rg` resource group that hosts the resources described in the following table.

[options="header",cols="a,,a"]
|===
| Resource | Type | Description

| `{org}-{deployment-name}-vnet`
| Virtual network
| The primary workload's virtual network with a single `default` subnet.

| `{org}-{deployment-name}-{defaultsubnetname}-nsg`
| Network security group
| Network security group attached to the `default` subnet.

| `{org}-{deployment-name}-udr`
| Route table
| User Defined Routes for routing traffic to and from the shared services and on-premises networks.

| `{org}-{deployment-name}-ddos-plan`
| DDOS protection plan
| Azure Standard DDOS protection plan.

| `{org}{deployment-name}diag{uniquestring}` (dashes removed)
| Storage account 
| Storage location for virtual network diagnostic data.
|===

==== Step 4: Deploy Azure Container Registry - Required role: SysOps

The next step is deploying the `acr` module, which creates an Azure Container Registry which is a private Docker registry in Azure for storing and managing your private Docker images.

[ALBERTWO REVIEW - Finish comments here]

Start the module deployment by running the following command based on the platform you are deploying from:

.Docker
[source,bash]
python vdc.py create workload -path archetypes/aks/archetypes.json -m acr

.Linux/OSX
[source,bash]
python3 vdc.py create workload -path archetypes/aks/archetypes.json -m acr

.Windows
[source,cmd]
py vdc.py create workload -path archetypes/aks/archetypes.json -m acr

This deployment creates the `{org}-{deployment-name}-acr-rg` resource group that hosts the resources described in the following table.

[options="header",cols="a,,"]
|===
| Resource | Type | Description

| `{org}{deployment-name}acr` 
| Azure Container Registry
| Azure Container Registry for storing and managing private Docker images.
|===

==== Step 5: Deploy AKS workload resources - Required role: ??? 
[CB REVIEW - Account needs Sub Owner permissions - ANNA FEEDBACK - Can lesser permissions be used?]

Once the monitoring, Key Vault, virtual network resources and Azure Container Registry are provisioned, your team can begin deploying the AKS workload resources. 

This step involves multiple resource deployments in the following order:

- The `aks` module creates the AKS Cluster resource, enabled monitoring and creates an Azure Firewall rule to enable egress to endpoints required for AKS cluster functionality. 
- The `role-assignments` module creates the required RBAC grants to the AKS cluster resource group `{org}-{deployment-name}-rg`.
- The `aks-node-role-assignments` module creates the required RBAC grants to the auto-generated AKS cluster resource group.
- The `permissions-scripts-pre-reqs` module runs scripts necessary to run custom scripts.
- The `scripts-pre-reqs` module runs scripts necessary to run custom scripts.
- The `create-ca-cert` module creates a CA cert using OpenSSL and places it in the key vault created in https://github.com/albertwo1978/vdc/blob/master/docs/archetypes/aks/overview.adoc#step-2-deploy-key-vault---required-role-secops[Step 3].
- The `create-cluster-rbac-role-bindings` module creates the AKS cluster roles and cluster role bindings for kubernetes RBAC integration with Azure Active Directory. 

Start the module deployments by running the following commands based on the platform you are deploying from:

.Docker
[source,bash]
python vdc.py create workload -path archetypes/aks/archetypes.json -m aks
python vdc.py create workload -path archetypes/aks/archetypes.json -m role-assignments
python vdc.py create workload -path archetypes/aks/archetypes.json -m aks-node-role-assignments
python vdc.py create workload -path archetypes/aks/archetypes.json -m aks-node-role-assignments
python vdc.py create workload -path archetypes/aks/archetypes.json -m scripts-pre-reqs
python vdc.py create workload -path archetypes/aks/archetypes.json -m create-ca-cert
python vdc.py create workload -path archetypes/aks/archetypes.json -m create-cluster-rbac-role-bindings

.Linux/OSX
[source,bash]
python3 vdc.py create workload -path archetypes/aks/archetypes.json -m aks
python3 vdc.py create workload -path archetypes/aks/archetypes.json -m role-assignments
python3 vdc.py create workload -path archetypes/aks/archetypes.json -m aks-node-role-assignments
python3 vdc.py create workload -path archetypes/aks/archetypes.json -m aks-node-role-assignments
python3 vdc.py create workload -path archetypes/aks/archetypes.json -m scripts-pre-reqs
python3 vdc.py create workload -path archetypes/aks/archetypes.json -m create-ca-cert
python3 vdc.py create workload -path archetypes/aks/archetypes.json -m create-cluster-rbac-role-bindings

.Windows
[source,cmd]
py vdc.py create workload -path archetypes/aks/archetypes.json -m aks
py vdc.py create workload -path archetypes/aks/archetypes.json -m role-assignments
py vdc.py create workload -path archetypes/aks/archetypes.json -m aks-node-role-assignments
py vdc.py create workload -path archetypes/aks/archetypes.json -m aks-node-role-assignments
py vdc.py create workload -path archetypes/aks/archetypes.json -m scripts-pre-reqs
py vdc.py create workload -path archetypes/aks/archetypes.json -m create-ca-cert
py vdc.py create workload -path archetypes/aks/archetypes.json -m create-cluster-rbac-role-bindings

This deployment creates the following resource groups and AKS archetype resources.

[options="header",cols="a,"]
|===
| Resource Group | Description

| `{org}-{deployment-name}-rg` 
| Azure AKS resource type for the managed kubernetes cluster.

| `MC_{org}-{deployment-name}-rg_{org}-{deployment-name}-k8s_{region}`
| Azure key vault for secret management.
